SO Here we go, it is a Machine Learning microservice that I have created using flaskApi in python.
It is to be used with the main server forming a req-res relation aka API calls.
I have mentioned about the format of request to be fed and the format of response that will be emitted back!

Please go through every files and remove personal notes and comments once you guys get the meaning of the scripts.


TO LAUNCH THE API STANDALONE :

    uvicorn main:app --reload || python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

then it should show you a local server, just add "/docs" to it inorder to enter the fastApi UI
